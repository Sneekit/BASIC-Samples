# BASIC-Samples
This repository contains sample code written in the BASIC programming language.

They provide examples of working with BASIC index files, performing inserts and updates, and deletes. At times it is more efficient to operate with the index alone, at other times the full record is needed.

The regression program is an examples of extracting data from BASIC index files and presenting it in a readable CSV.
